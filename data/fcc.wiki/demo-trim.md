The chatwiki only shows up to the first `h2` heading, marked with two # symbols.
This is a piece of demo content showing embedded scripts. 
The first paragraph should display inside the chat.
The second paragraph won't show in wiki chat, but will show if you click through.

```js
function test(a, b) {
  return (a+b);
}
```

## second paragraph
This is the 2nd paragraph of content which is "below the fold" and won't be visible in the chat.
