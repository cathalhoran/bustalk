## Using the Wiki

The Free Code Camp wiki exists to provide clear answers to common questions about Free Code Camp, learning to code, and getting a coding job. Please feel free to add relevant content to the wiki. Just be sure to search for a topic and see if it already exists before starting a new page.

Individual Wiki's can be accessed from the main page, or from other linked Wiki pages.

You can also access them from Gitter using Camperbot

- **`help $topic`**

  Finds related materials to that topic, usually a page from the [wiki](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki). Examples: `help css` `help bootstrap`

- **`topics`**

  Shows the list of topics.

- **`find $topic`**

  This will search for entries that include `$topic` in the title. Example: `find wiki`

## Contribution Guides

We currently have a couple of guides to help you contribute, via the browser, command line or desktop application.

- [How To Contribute From Your Browser:](Wiki-Contribute-Online) This is currently the easiest way we have to contribute. A simplified version can be found on [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-land-your-first-open-source-contribution-from-your-browser-in-15-minutes-756d9bbf81ad) also.
- [How To Contribute To The Wiki Locally:](Wiki-Contribute-Local-GUI) This is a guide that will show you how to have a local copy so you can make changes from your computer, it also works for contributing to the main repository.
- [Pull Request Guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
- [More on how to make a pull request from a fork](Pull-Request-Contribute)
- [How to Squash Commits:](git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one) We required only one commit per Pull Request unless otherwise specified by a moderator.

### Labels

Before creating your first pull request or starting your work as an issue moderator it is strongly suggested to get familiar with the [labels guide](Wiki-Labels-Guide). This will provide you with a through understanding on our labeling system so you can proper utilize it and keep a stable workflow.

For labels on a global levels on FreeCodeCamp's repositories you can follow [this](Select-Issues-for-Contributing-Using-Labels) guide.

### Issues

Creating issues in general is simpler than creating a pull request.

- [Creating a New Github Issue](Creating-a-New-Github-Issue)
- [Searching for Your Issue on Github](Searching-for-Your-Issue-on-Github)

### Moderators

If you are really committed to contributing to the wiki and you would like to join the team and be able to merge pull request, create new labels, assign mods to specific pull request and more then just check the [requirements to become a wiki mod](Wiki-Become-A-Wiki-Mod) and follow the instructions.

[**Improve someone's pull request:**](Wiki-Improve-PR) At some point while managing the influx of pull request, you will be faced with the choice of letting an old contribution die out because the improvements needed have not been applied, or you could take contribution and improve it while also keeping the initial contributor's work. Often times, the later is the best choice.

### Translation

We aim to translate all our articles in as many languages as supported. For this, we need people willing to collaborate and translate articles. We have a series of articles that will help you get started and solve any issues.

- [**Translation Guides**](Translations-Guide)

## Templates

We have a few templates for different aspects of the wiki, such as different articles and fixed information to help contribute.

### Article Templates

These kind of templates are a guide to the creation of new articles such as algorithms challenges, and informational articles.

- [JavaScript Articles](Wiki-Template-JavaScript)
- [Challenge Solutions](Wiki-Template-Challenge-Solution)

### Contribution Templates

These templates are visible when you are trying to contribute to the Wiki. They will provide you with useful information, guides, and guidelines that you must follow to ensure a proper contribution.

- [Pull Request](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
