For the Git Challenges you just have to follow the instructions closely. From how to create your [c9](http://c9.io/) account to completing the tutorial.

For that you will need `git-it` to go to the challenges, and `git-it verify` to check that you completed it correctly. For detailed instructions read them here: [http://jlord.us/git-it/index.html](http://jlord.us/git-it/index.html)
