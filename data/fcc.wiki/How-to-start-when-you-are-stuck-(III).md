### Tips

* Always look at your logs, keep your console open. You can spot errors faster this way. To open the console log on chrome: click right -> inspect -> console There are so many errors that come from typos and so much time lost that you can save just by developing this very simple habit 
* Pair with other programmers as much as you can
* Read the documentation. You can install a very helpful [MDN Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mdn-search/ffpifaemeofjmncjdbegmbpcdaemkeoc) and use it as much and often as you need to
* Follow the help tips provided by Free Code Camp in the “More informations” section. The answer is there!
* Try to solve the problem in more than one way, always try to make it better, more readable, a lower complexity time, less memory
* If none of the above steps work, ask for help :)
