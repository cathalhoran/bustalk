We've added a bot to some of the chatrooms. We'll be adding more features over time, but these are the starting features. We'd love to hear what you think!
The main thing is pulling in content from our [brand new wiki](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki), right into the chat.

- `find js` or `find css` or `find html`  
show a list of matching items.

- `help js ternary`  
quick definition/help. click through to see more on the wiki

- `help video`  
inline video

- `help bobbytables`  
shows inline images

- `explain triphop`
you can embed soundcloud tracks

- `topics`  
  show a list of topics
