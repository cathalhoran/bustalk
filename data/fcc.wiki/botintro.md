Hay All! We're working on a new CamperBot for FreeCodeCamp. 
This will make the chat rooms more fun and useful. 
It will pull in content from our [brand new wiki](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/) right into the chat room.

# Basic commands
We're adding more features all the time. But here are some basics

```
help
find TOPIC
wiki TOPIC
about @user
thanks @user
```

## adding to the wiki
you can add topics to the main wiki, and these will get updated and pulled into the chat.
Please add material!
