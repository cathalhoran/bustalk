When you get stuck, remember: Read-Search-Ask.

1) **Read** the documentation or error    
2) **Search** Google    
3) **Ask** your friends for help    

This is the most time-efficient way to handle being stuck, and it's the most respectful of other people's time, too.

Most of the time, you'll solve your problem after just one or two steps of this algorithm.

Learning to code is hard. But it's a lot easier if you ask for help when you need it!
