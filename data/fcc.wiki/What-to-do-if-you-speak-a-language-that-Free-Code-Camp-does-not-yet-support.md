Translation is an all-or-nothing proposal.

We won't be able to add new languages to Free Code Camp until all of our 
challenges are translated into that language.

In addition to translating these initially, we'll also need to maintain 
the translation as the challenges are gradually updated (we use the 
github issue system to keep record).  

If you're able to help us, please join the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators)
and read the [TranslationGuide](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/blob/master/Translations-Guide.md)
