Free Code Camp Campsites represent a localized experience of our community. These Facebook groups are the place to organize Coffee-and-Code style events, pair program locally in hack sessions, or share news about other coding-related events in your area. 

Whether you live in a major metropolitan area, or a small town, we encourage you to join or create your campsite to meet other busy people learning to code.
